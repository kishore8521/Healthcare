# Project Title: Health Care Patient Data Analysis
## Description:

This project involves detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a healthcare dataset containing patient information. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights related to patient demographics, medical conditions, and hospital operations that can assist in improving healthcare decision-making and resource allocation.

## Key Features:

* Data Exploration: Loaded and cleaned a structured patient dataset with attributes such as:

Age, Gender

Admission and Discharge Dates

Medical Conditions and Test Results

Doctor and Hospital Details

Billing Amounts and Insurance Providers

* Visual Analysis: Used matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to visualize:

Distribution of patient age groups

Gender-wise patient count

Frequency of medical conditions

Hospital admission trends

Insurance coverage statistics

* Insights Derived:

Identified most common medical conditions.

Analyzed seasonal or time-based admission trends.

Highlighted billing and insurance-related patterns.

## Technologies Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly


## Potential Extensions:

Predictive modeling for hospital readmission or diagnosis.

Integration with real-time health APIs for dynamic updates.

Aids insurance companies in claim and billing analysis

Provides a data-driven approach for patient care improvement
